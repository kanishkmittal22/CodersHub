    <string name="codeforcesQuestion">Harsh You are given a sequence of integers a of length 2n. You have to split these 2n integers into n pairs; each pair will represent the coordinates of a point on a plane. Each number from the sequence a should become the x or y coordinate of exactly one point. Note that some points can be equal.\n\nAfter the points are formed, you have to choose a path s that starts from one of these points, ends at one of these points, and visits all points at least once.\n\nThe length of path s is the sum of distances between all adjacent points on the path. In this problem, the distance between two points (x1,y1) and (x2,y2) is defined as |x1−x2|+|y1−y2|.\n\nYour task is to form n points and choose a path s in such a way that the length of path s is minimized.</string>
